<h1>Why Immerser?</h1>
<p>
  Nowadays designers tends to create complex logic and fix parts of the interface. Also they colour page sections
  contrastly. How to deal with this mess? Immerser can help you.
</p>
<p>Immerser doesn't have any dependencies and is written on vanilla js. Only 3.45kb gzipped.</p>
<p>
  Immerser fast, because it calculates states once on init. Then it watchs the scroll position and schedules redraw DOM
  in the next event loop tick with requestAnimationFrame. Script changes transform property, so it uses graphic hardware
  acceleration.
</p>
<p>
  You may need to create custom markup in two cases: save event listeners on nodes or different fixed markup for each
  layer.
