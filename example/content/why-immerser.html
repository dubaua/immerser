<h1>Why Immerser?</h1>
<p>
  Nowadays designers tends to&nbsp;create complex logic and fix parts of&nbsp;the&nbsp;interface. Also they colour page
  sections contrastly. How to&nbsp;deal with this mess? Immerser can help you.
</p>
<p>
  Immerser fast, because it&nbsp;calculates states once on&nbsp;init. Then it&nbsp;watchs the&nbsp;scroll position and
  schedules redraw <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> in&nbsp;the&nbsp;next event loop tick with requestAnimationFrame. Script changes transform property,
  so&nbsp;it&nbsp;uses graphic hardware acceleration.
</p>
<p>
  Immerser doesn&rsquo;t have any dependencies and is&nbsp;written on&nbsp;vanilla&nbsp;js. Only&nbsp;3.1kb gzipped.
