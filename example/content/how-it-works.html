<h1>How it&nbsp;Works?</h1>
<p>First, immerser gathers information about the layers, solids, window and document.</p>
<p>
  Then it&nbsp;creates a&nbsp;statemap for each layer, containing all necessary information, when the layer
  is&nbsp;partially and fully in&nbsp;viewport.
</p>
<p>
  After that immerser modifies DOM, cloning all solids into mask containers for each layer and appling the classnames
  given in&nbsp;configuration. If&nbsp;you have added a&nbsp;pager, immerser also creates links for layers.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, immerser binds listeners to&nbsp;scroll and resize events. On&nbsp;resize, it&nbsp;will meter layers, the
  window and document heights again and recalculate the statemap. On&nbsp;scroll, immerser moves a&nbsp;mask
  of&nbsp;solids to&nbsp;show part of&nbsp;each solid group according to&nbsp;the layer below.
