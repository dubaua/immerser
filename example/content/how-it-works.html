<h1>How it Works?</h1>
<p>First, immerser gathers information about the layers, solids, window and document.</p>
<p>
  Then it creates a statemap for each layer, containing all necessary information, when the layer is partially and fully
  in viewport.
</p>
<p>
  After that immerser modifies DOM, cloning all solids into mask containers for each layer and appling the classnames
  given in configuration. If you have added a pager, immerser also creates links for layers.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, immerser binds listeners to scroll and resize events. On resize, it will meter layers, the window and
  document heights again and recalculate the statemap. On scroll, immerser moves a mask of solids to show part of each
  solid group according to the layer below.
