<h1>Custom Markup</h1>
<p>
  Since immerser cloning nested nodes by&nbsp;default, all event listeners and data bound on&nbsp;nodes will be lost after
  init. Fortunatelly, you can markup the&nbsp;immmerser yourself. It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;useful when you have event listeners
  on&nbsp;solids, reactive logic or&nbsp;more than classname switching. All you need is&nbsp;to&nbsp;place the number
  of&nbsp;nested immerser masks equal to&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;the layers. Look how I change the smily emoji
  on&nbsp;the right in&nbsp;this page source.
